Our implementation is almost fully functional, with the exception of a 
few errors that should be thrown but aren't, like in the case of two functions 
having the same name, and a procedure returning a value.
The only unnecssarily thrown error messages come in test42.
We added two helper functions checkComp and transTypeFields.
